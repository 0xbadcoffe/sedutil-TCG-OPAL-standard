1. Develop the PBA and add the code to load it to the shadow MBR.
	At this point I am still researching what would be the best code base
	for the PBA.  The two options I'm looking at right now are GRUB2 and
	the PBA code used in Truecrypt.

2. Rationalize and simplify the UI.
	Currently the code does each task as a single, unique command.
	This then requires multiple invocations to perform at task. I
	think these need to be reduced to a few high level commands like:
	  --initialSetup -p password 
	  --setLockingRangeRO Global
	  --setLockingRangeRW Global
	  --setMBRShadow (enabled | disabled)
	  --setMDRDone
	The low-level commands would be left in place for advanced
	use and/or troubleshooting.
3. ADD more error checking.
	At a minimum MsedCommand needs to check for overflow and memory allocations need
	to be checked for failure.
4. Find and fix the inevitable bugs.
